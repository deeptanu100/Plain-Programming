# Plain 🗣️

**A programming language that reads like English.**

Plain is designed so anyone who speaks English can read and write code without prior programming experience. No brackets, braces, semicolons, or cryptic symbols — just clear, readable instructions.

```plain
set name to "World"
say "Hello, " + name + "!"

repeat 3 times
    say "Plain is awesome!"
end repeat
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Python Interpreter

```bash
# Run a Plain program
python plain.py examples/greeting.plain

# Interactive REPL
python plain.py
```

### Option 2: Web Playground

**🚀 Play with Plain in your browser:** [deeptanu100.github.io/Plain-Programming](https://deeptanu100.github.io/Plain-Programming/)

You can also run it locally:
```bash

## 🛠️ Development

### Requirements
- **Python 3.8+** for the command-line interpreter
- Any modern **web browser** for the playground
- **VS Code** (optional) for syntax highlighting

### Running the Playground Locally
```bash
cd playground
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Installing the VS Code Extension
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions → `...` → "Install from VSIX" (or copy the folder to `~/.vscode/extensions/`)
3. Open any `.plain` file to see syntax highlighting
